# peCHYRON-flow-cytometry
These files are saved as .acs workspaces, which include the raw .fcs files as well as any analysis done (as in Extended Data Figure 4c-d).

One file includes data from the cell sorting performed in the experiment shown in Figure 3. All other files are from the experiment shown in Extended Data Figure 4.

For the experiment shown in Figure 3, the identity of the tubes is as follows:
1-2: An alternative protocol that ended up being dropped when it had roughly equivalent activity to the protocol in the paper, as assessed at an early timepoint, replicate A.
3-4: An alternative protocol that ended up being dropped when it had roughly equivalent activity to the protocol in the paper, as assessed at an early timepoint, replicate B.
5-6: Replicate A, shown in Figure 3.
7-8: Replicate B, the tube was dropped and became contaminated.
9-10: Replicate C, shown in Figure 3.
11-12: Replicate D, shown in Figure 3.

For the experiment shown in Extended Data Figure 4, the samples are as follows:
1-3: replicates of peCHYRON with the protective nicking sgRNA
4-6: replicates of peCHYRON without the protective nicking sgRNA
C: means the indicated sample grown in competition with its parent cell line 
R: means the indicated sample grown alone

For the 6-day sort only:
C1-C6: samples of the parent cell line put through the FACS before mixing with the samples with which they would compete
7: Transfection of PB-cargo green-marked pegRNAs only, to act as compensation control for later timepoints.
8: Transfection of PB-cargo red-marked pegRNAs only, to act as compensation control for later timepoints.
